<h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>
This Sales Dashboard project was developed to provide clear insights into retail sales performance by leveraging a multi-year transactional dataset. The data includes order-level details such as order date, customer name, state, product category, sub-category, product name, sales amount, quantity sold, and profit. The dashboard visualizes key dimensions—including sales by category, sales by state, customer trends, top customers, and profit over time—to support data-driven decision-making for business growth.
</p>
<h4>Analysis</h4>
<p>Dataset Overview: The dataset covers multiple years, featuring dimensions such as product category (Furniture, Office Supplies, Technology), state-wise sales, sub-categories, and financial measures (Sales, Profit, Quantity).</p>
<p>Sales by Category: The funnel chart reveals that Phones and Chairs are the highest revenue-generating categories, while categories like Fasteners and Labels have the least sales volumes.</p>
<p>Profit Over Time: A line plot displays category-wise profit trends, showing steady growth in Technology and Office Supplies profits, while Furniture profits remain relatively flat.</p>
<p>Sales by State: Geographical mapping showcases strong sales in states like California and Texas, highlighting regional strengths and areas for market development.</p>
<p>Customer Growth: Year-wise customer count is consistently increasing, pointing to effective customer acquisition and retention strategies.</p>
<p>Top Customers: A small set of customers, such as Tamara Chand and Raymond Buch, contribute disproportionately to overall profits.</p>
<p>Seasonal Trends: Sales by month reveal periodic spikes&mdash;typically in the second half of the year&mdash;helping pinpoint optimal periods for promotions and inventory ramp-up.</p>

<h4>Conclusions</h4>
